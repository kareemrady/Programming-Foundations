#!User_name will make any value false except nil and false will be flipped to true.
#words.uniq! will mutate the words array and cause the changes to be actually written to the words array
# should give an error unless in the context of ternary operation
#Usually that is a ruby naming standard for methods that returns booleans example .include? .zero? , etc...
# !! it will return a boolean equivalent (boolean conversion)of the object , which should be true for any object except for nil and false
